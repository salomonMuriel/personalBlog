Colombia and Latin America have [a ton](https://www.kupa.co/) [of cool](https://balbamo.com/) [boutique](https://www.inmaculadavj.com/) [consumer-goods](https://www.lapukids.com/) [brands](https://www.pandawabeach.shop/) that could sell for a good margin in the US and Europe while maintaining a decent margin due to the lowish cost of manufacturing in LatAm.

Because of how the economics work out, these brands sell for what would be considered a premium price in their local market, limiting their market reach. Many of these are also bootstrapped businesses with low financing available, with founding teams that are not knowledgeable on how to scale up a good product or how to reach international markets.

You could group a bunch of these businesses under the same website/storefront, advertising them to US and EU customers as zany, Latino-owned, up-and-coming brands. [This already happens](https://www.ambardae.com/) [physically in Colombia](https://www.instagram.com/casacientoocho_/?hl=en) [to some success](https://www.instagram.com/casaflormorado/?hl=en) as there are a ton of "multi-brand local entrepreneur stores" all around. The idea would be to take that concept, amp it up to 11 and bring it to a larger, more affluent market.
