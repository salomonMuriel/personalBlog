Together with my wife, we bought the domain www.repitis.com a couple of years ago. We totally suffer from domain-name shopping addiction. Another one of our other great acquisitions was www.bigassants.com (to sell [this Colombian delicacy](https://www.tastingtable.com/1139773/big-butt-ants-are-a-south-american-delicacy/)).

"Repitis" means "to repeat something soon or immediately" in Colombian parlance. Typically used when doing something fun like a board game or pleasurable like sweet food, or more commonly, sex. Our initial idea since we just had the babies was to put up a circular economy website for baby clothing and items that get discarded as the kids grow out of them.

We quickly realized that was kind of a logistical nightmare (baby items get dangerously close to biohazard waste status ‚ò£Ô∏è), but the domain name is so fucking good we just need to use it on something.

We thought about a board game import company, but the margins were too low to make it lucrative and we would compete vs. Amazon delivery. Now, we just don't know what to use it for! My latest ideas hover towards a dedicated place to sell old videogames and consoles.

Do you have some idea of what we might use repitis.com for? [Let me know!](https://wa.me/573132465100)
