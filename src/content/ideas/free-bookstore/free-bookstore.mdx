While in Chicago I saw 2 bookstores that were really extraordinary: [Books4Cause](https://www.books4cause.com/) and [OpenBooks](https://www.open-books.org/). 

They both have similar models: They are sustained by monetizing a portion of books donated to them. The rest of the books they give away in one way or another.

I found this model fascinating. Books4Cause in particular is not a non-profit, and it's profitable. A free bookstore that is profitable. Amazing ðŸ¤¯

I think I could build something similar in Colombia or Latin America. I believe I could have a subscription-based model for access to a set amount of books monthly while getting donations in order to get a better total catalogue and give away a portion as free books to the community.
