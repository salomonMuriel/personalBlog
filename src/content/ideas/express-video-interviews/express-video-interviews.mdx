In my experience, the most bothersome part of recruiting someone new into your team is the first round of disqualifications. You go, make a nice post on LinkedIn, and suddenly you have 20+ applicants you want to interview. Now, talking to all of them will take at least 30 mins each or 20 hours total, so in practice, you end up shortlisting only 5 or so and hope for the best.

What if you could lower that initial time from 30 minutes to only 5? The idea is to make a small service that lets you input a set of screening questions to be answered in less than 1 minute each. Candidates would record themselves answering them on the website and whatever came out, came out. No second takes!

Bonus function: have [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) make a transcript of the answers and then automatically use [GPT-4's API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) to rate candidates based on your expected answers.

This format would also lower the chance the candidate uses AI to provide him an answer since there will be such a short time to answer.
