In a recent chat with a [colleague at R5](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pabloarmida/), he opened my eyes to an undeniable truth: Most instructional books could tell you all you need to know and be over in 50 pages or less. The rest of the content is just fluff.

Now, I've been reading a lot lately and I couldn't agree more. I loved [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299) but James Clear really goes overboard with the examples. He even has a [1-page summary](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits-summary) of the book which could replace the whole thing easily.

Maybe you could build a publisher that admonishes and embraces this fact, and instead of going for length, values conciseness. You could even sell "compilations" of several books, which together make up the typical length of a more typical, bullshit-fluff-literary piece. 

I think the [writing style of Derek Sivers](https://sivers.com/) embodies this. His books are typically under 100 pages long, most pages are not packed but rather have just the minimum to convey their message.
