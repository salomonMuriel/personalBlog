## My running spree

Natalia had been (rightfully) nagging me to start exercising for about a year now. Having kids keeps us active (I lost 15Kg since they were born!), but its no replacement for a workout. If I wanna keep up with them now and in 30 years, I better shape up.

After several false starts, my friend [Nico Varón](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasvaronrodriguez/) suggested something crazy: "Run the Half-Marathon with me". "3 months to train are plenty" he said.

I have no idea why I trusted him, but I got a training plan out of Hal Higdon's website and next Sunday I was out running (and panting all the way). At the time I'm writing this I have run 19/45 training runs, have massively improved my fitness in ~8 weeks (with another 8 to go). I went from not being able to run 5K without walking to running it in 26 minutes. I also signed Natalia up for the Half Marathon (without asking her), so we are in this together!

I'm completely amazed both at the rate of progress and at what my body is capable of. I'm hooked!

PD: Shoutout to [Byron @ The Runner's High](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-runners-high-miami). We got our running shoes there, he was amazing.

## Happiness Meter 🤩

8/10. Running and family have given me a ton of joy over the last couple of months, but the pressure to start producing income is becoming an important factor in my life. We expect to launch sales for my new venture in June 14th, so fingers crossed 🤞

## Family 💛

Running with Nata has been the first time we share a hobby (besides assembling furniture together), so it has been great to push each other to keep up with the training plan.

Franco and Luca are becoming independent little people. They now suddenly decide they want to do a sleepover at their grandma's (without letting us know), choose what they wear daily and have begun insisting on wanting a dog 🐶

They also recently asked for a baby sister. What a thought.

We got to travel to see my dad in Miami. We hadn't seen him since October, but we really made up for the lost time. We got to run the Miami Boardwalk and then cool off in the sea!

Franco ditched the nightly airplane. He now is back to being obsessed with soccer. Luca is now constantly singing, both known songs and his original compositions.

## Entrepreneurship📚

My venture is now about to launch. It aims to create a new model for Higher Education. We will start with a short program (~12 weeks) aimed at professionals, and will be launching publicly on June 14th. Soon!
