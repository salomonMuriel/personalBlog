  Child-like wonder can get you to inventiveness.

* Children defy expected uses of life's building blocks
  * Building library out of books - use is not what intended, but works nonetheless.
  * Both twins can be Peter Parker - There can be 2 of something thought unique.
  * Lateral thinking is encouraged, not curbed.
* Technology can be indistinguishable from magic
  * Algorithms as 'spells'
  * Programmers as 'shamans'. Know some spells, but not all (and most probably always the same few basic ones)
  * Technology is a build-up of smaller blocks. Some blocks are only understood by very few people.
* Wonder at technology blocks
  * One should wonder at how 'basic-everyday' tech works.
  * One can then learn new spells - blocks
  * Use them in unintended/unexpected ways.
* Child-like wonder leads you to invention, novelty, creativity.
  * Encourage your own lateral thinking
  * Think the building blocks -spells- you know. In what novel ways can you use them?
