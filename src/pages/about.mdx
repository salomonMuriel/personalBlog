##### Last updated August 9, 2025 from my home in Bogot√°.

If you want to know more about my work, [check out my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smuriel/). If you want to know more about me in general, here you go üëá

## The Basics

I'm precisely {((today - birthday)/31536000000).toFixed(0)} years and {Math.floor((today - new Date (today.getFullYear(), 0, 0))/(1000 * 60 * 60 * 24))} days old. I was born on January 1st, 1991 which isn't that great since it's quite hard to get any kind of celebration going when everyone is traveling, hungover, or both. Logically I had to do something about it so I've celebrated my birthday on April 20th since ~15 years ago. Some years I've celebrated my birthday on 3 different dates!

My parents are both Colombian and I was born and raised in Bogot√° with my sister Paloma (or Paloca, as my kids call her). I'm happily married to my lifelong girlfriend. As of today, we've been together for over {((today - together)/31536000000).toFixed(0)} years. We got married in 2018 and had Franco and Luca (the super twins üë∂üèºüë∂üèº) in 2022. They are rambunctious, amazing, uncontrollable balls of chaos and joy. Not coincidentally, we don't have any more kids. Also, having twins is great exercise: I lost 14kg since they were born (and I'm a voracious eater, especially when it comes to rice).

## Hobbies and Passions

Technology has been a lifelong passion. I never liked soccer (quite rare in Colombia) and grew up glued to whatever videogame I could get my hands on üëæ. Fun fact, I learned English through online gaming! Since I spent so much time in front of computers I ended up loving tech and being quite a proud geek. Other than gaming, I enjoy a good beer (even better in good company), making friends, traveling and a good BBQ. Most of all, I love spending time with my family, both immediate and extended.

My other great passion is being a Maker. I love to create new things: companies, work projects, household renovations or furniture, prototypes, cooking recipes, activities, games for the kids, you name it. I'm the kind of guy with a rack full of tools and a 3D Printer, constantly tinkering üß∞.

## Work = Play

I've been blessed with working in my passions and making decent money while at it. Most people know me not for my tech side but because I build companies. I've created 4 companies, of which 2 went broke and 2 I managed to sell.

[You can see more about my companies here](/companies) or on my LinkedIn.

Building companies has been a family tradition for a couple of generations now. [My dad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raul-h-muriel-b-3904b62/) is a successful entrepreneur (currently building new ventures as well!) and his father before him too. I'm constantly on the lookout for new opportunities.

I'm currently building [Ignia](https://www.ignia.lat?utm_source=salomon-personal-site), a new model for Higher Education. I find working on more impact-driven ventures more fulfilling personally.
