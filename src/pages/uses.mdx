Stuff I'm currently using.

## The OS

[![My distro of choice.](@assets/posts/uses/logo-mint.png)](https://linuxmint.com/) Mainly because it is Debian-based, easy to customize, and great at handling multiple screens with differing resolutions and DPIs.

I also use Windows for occasional gaming, but I got a Steam Deck (‚ù§Ô∏è) so it will be even more occasional now.

## The Software

- **Browser**: Brave
- **Code Editor**: VSCode.
- **Database Client**: DBeaver
- **API Testing**: Insomnia
- **Shell**: ZSH + Oh My ZSH!

## Programming Languages, Frameworks and others.

- **Languages**: üêç Python, TypeScript and SQL.
- **Backend Frameworks**: FastAPI, Django, and NodeJS.
- **Frontend Frameworks**: React + NextJS and Astro.
- **Database Engines**: PostgreSQL is my go-to, but I've touched most major engines. I hate Mongo üò†.
- **Data Science stuff**: Pandas, Polars, Redshift for warehousing, PySpark, Airflow, probably every AWS and GCP Data-related product (sorry Azure), Metabase, a ton of NLP libraries, DVC, Tensorflow and Pytorch, scikit-learn + XGboost + LightGBM for quick models, Pycaret for even quicker models, optuna for good models, and I'm probably forgetting a few. I've spent a ton of time in Data Science üìä.
- **Cloud Providers**: GCP, AWS and Heroku (RIP üíÄ). I'm currently most familiar with AWS's offerings, in particular for web deployment and data.

## üë®‚Äçüíª My Workstation

I've been building this baby since 2013 (initially for gaming). I used my first-ever salary for the first set of parts, and stuff had been getting replaced up until ~2019. It reeeeally needs another update, but life + the GPU market have been holding me back. Anyway, most of my work gets done on it.

#### üñ• Internals

- **Board**: MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX
- **Processor**: AMD Ryzen 3700X
- **RAM**: Corsair 32GB DDR4 3200Hz
- **GPU**: EVGA Nvidia GTX 1070Ti
- **Storage**: 1x M.2 NVMe Samsung 970 EVO + 2x Western Digital Blue SATAs

#### üñ•Ô∏è Monitors

- 1x [ViewSonic XG2402](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075D1B4SV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- 2x [LG 27UL500-W](https://www.amazon.com/LG-27UL500-W-27-Inch-Freesync-Technology/dp/B07PGL2WVS/)

#### MouseüêÅ and Keyboard ‚å®Ô∏è

- **Mouse**: [Logitech G403](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g403-hero-gaming-mouse.910-005630.html)
- **Keyboard**: [Keychron Q6](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q6-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard?variant=39990022963289)

Hopefully next year I take the leap and upgrade everything! But alas, I've said that for like 5 years now.

## üì± Gadgets and other cool stuff

- **3D Printer**: Bambu Lab P1S. This beauty is amazing. I love it ü§ü.
- **Tinkering Toy**: Raspberry Pi 4. It's been used as a home-wide VPN, a 3D printer manager, a Steam game streamer for my TV, a temporary server for one of my companies, and of course as a paperweight. I want to use it for a robot, but robotics is still black magic to me.
- **Gaming Console**: Besides my computer I had a Switch and a PS5. I barely used the PS5, the Switch has too few good games and I had played all of the great ones, so I sold both. I used the money to get myself a Steam Deck üöÄ.
- **Work Chair**: Premium chair from [Bound](https://bound.com.co/sillas-oficina/). It's like sitting on a cloud.
