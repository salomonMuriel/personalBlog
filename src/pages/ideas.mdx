Somewhere to publicly write the ideas I get. If you have any feedback, if you feel we can work together to make any of these happen, or if you have an idea you think we can build together, [let's talk](https://wa.me/573132465100)!

## ‚è© Express Video Interviews
##### Added March 5th, 2024

In my experience, the most bothersome part of recruiting someone new into your team is the first round of disqualifications. You go, make a nice post on LinkedIn, and suddenly you have 20+ applicants you want to interview. Now, talking to all of them will take at least 30 mins each or 20 hours total, so in practice, you end up shortlisting only 5 or so and hope for the best.

What if you could lower that initial time from 30 minutes to only 5? The idea is to make a small service that lets you input a set of screening questions to be answered in less than 1 minute each. Candidates would record themselves answering them on the website and whatever came out, came out. No second takes!

Bonus function: have [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) make a transcript of the answers and then automatically use [GPT-4's API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) to rate candidates based on your expected answers.

## üëóüï∂Ô∏è Boutique Brand Marketplace
##### Added March 5th, 2024

Colombia and Latin America have [a ton](https://www.kupa.co/) [of cool](https://balbamo.com/) [boutique](https://www.inmaculadavj.com/) [consumer-goods](https://www.lapukids.com/) [brands](https://www.pandawabeach.shop/) that could sell for a good margin in the US and Europe while maintaining a decent margin due to the lowish cost of manufacturing in LatAm.

Because of how the economics work out, these brands sell for what would be considered a premium price in their local market, limiting their market reach. Many of these are also bootstrapped businesses with low financing available, with founding teams that are not knowledgeable on how to scale up a good product or how to reach international markets.

You could group a bunch of these businesses under the same website/storefront, advertising them to US and EU customers as zany, Latino-owned, up-and-coming brands. [This already happens](https://www.ambardae.com/) [physically in Colombia](https://www.instagram.com/casacientoocho_/?hl=en) [to some success](https://www.instagram.com/casaflormorado/?hl=en) as there are a ton of "multi-brand local entrepreneur stores" all around. The idea would be to take that concept, amp it up to 11 and bring it to a larger, more affluent market.

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Mid-sized Mall Renovation
##### Added March 5th, 2024

There are 2 malls very near to my place in Bogot√°, which is located in a reasonably affluent part of the city. [One has the most expensive square-meter-rent-price in the country](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BybozbmXjMEEEFT6A). [The other is just ~2 blocks away](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MHFq3QybZ1yZfLEJ7) but has 1/10th the rent price because of how run down it is.

The second one is also extremely well located. It's at the intersection of 2 main roads, the [sunday Ciclovia](https://www.idrd.gov.co/recreacion/ciclovia-bogotana) passes right in front of it and has several restaurants and bars nearby. It simply wasn't maintained over time and now is an eyesore in an otherwise great zone.

The idea would be to buy this place, renovate it and rent the commercial space out for somewhere around 5 to 8 times the current price, leveling it to the zone average. 

I LOVE this idea. The only bad part is that mortgage interest rates have skyrocketed in Colombia (currently around ~13% yearly) so the lease would probably be too expensive at the moment. Maybe there is some other way to finance the project that is less vulnerable to interest rates...
