## Family 💛

90% of my free time goes to my family. Monkeying around is my true full-time job 🐒, and I have a couple of very cute and demanding 2-year-old bosses demanding I work overtime! 

## Gaming 🎮

I've always been a PC gamer, but I had consoles for the occasional first-party AAA release. I recently sold my Switch and PS5 because of lack of use (I had already gone through all the titles I deemed worthy). I had been itching to go back to PC gaming, but hunkering down in my office to play is simply not possible with my 2 kids around (and not something I want to do anyways, gotta play with them while they are awake!). So I decided to buy myself a Steam Deck and have been playing diverse roguelikes while the kids sleep.

## Work 🧰

I'm currently a Tech Director for New Product Development in [R5](https://www.grupor5.com/), a Colombian Fintech focused on products for vehicle owners. That means I manage the web development and data teams for all our new ideas that we want to test out, which is currently ~15 people including myself. I previously created and managed the Data team for the whole company as its Data Director.

My work mainly entails a ton of coding, team management, strategy + culture work together with the rest of the C-Team and collaborating on product ideas together with [Ricardo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardo-buitrago/) and [Fernando](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandosucre/), who manage the product and business side of NPD.

## Entrepreneurship 🤩

My initial idea after selling Finco was to create an impact-focused Fintech, aimed at facilitating higher education for promising but disadvantaged young people. They would have paid back with income-sharing after graduating (you can read more details in [/ideas](/ideas/)). That didn't pan out because of the macroeconomics of the moment (luckily).

I've since learned that creating a large-scale, social-impact company is even riskier than founding a 'normal' tech startup. Since I now have responsibilities with the future of my children, I decided I must first lower my risk to a point where I'm financially comfortable with the prospect of complete failure, so that I can truly aim for the moon 🚀.

Hence, before launching my social impact venture I've been looking into creating a _⭐lifestyle business⭐_, and not necessarily a tech-based one at that. A lifestyle business is one where you are not aiming for complete world domination, profit-maximizing, or infinite-growth metrics, but rather just to achieve a stable level of income.

This can be a [niche SaaS 👩‍💻](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/calendesk/revenue), [a car wash 🚗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRaRsK6lnlo), a medium-sized mall, [a piece of cool hardware](https://tinypilotkvm.com/), or anything really. Just not something that would be interesting to a typical VC, not something that is likely to become a unicorn, and most definitely not something that requires high-complexity teams and processes. It must be simple (at least compared to a VC-backed tech startup), manageable and stable-ish.

I spend a lot of my time brainstorming possible ideas that fit this description, as well as lurking on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) for inspiration. You can see some in my [/ideas](/ideas/) page.
