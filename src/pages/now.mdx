What's happening in my life right about now.

## Happiness Meter ü§©

9/10. Want my sense of smell back!

## Family üíõ

Every day is filled with antics. Just this week Franco sneaked into my office (he can now open circular handles üôà) and took all my 3D printing filaments (~20 boxes) plus a handful of books to build a tower. When I caught him, the building was finished and twice his height.

Luca has taken to calling me "Papita", which I love ‚ù§Ô∏è

We have big family plans: we are going on a 4-month trip to the US in order to change the scenery and gain some insight into how we work as a family without the help of grandmothers, a nanny or a maid. Natalia is excited!

## Gaming üéÆ

Been getting my money's worth out of the Steam Deck. I think I've player more in the past 3 months than in the previous 2 years combined.

Latest time-sinkers:
* [Shogun Showdown](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2084000/Shogun_Showdown/)
* [Hades II](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/)

## Work üß∞

I'm currently a Tech Director for New Product Development in [R5](https://www.grupor5.com/), a Colombian Fintech focused on products for vehicle owners. That means I manage the web, mobile development and data teams for all our new ideas that we want to test out, which is currently ~17 people including myself. I previously created and managed the Data team for the whole company as its Data Director.

My work mainly entails a ton of coding, team management, strategy + culture work together with the rest of the C-Team and collaborating on product ideas together with [Ricardo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardo-buitrago/) and [Fernando](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandosucre/), who manage the product and business side of NPD.

## Entrepreneurship ü§©

I've been meeting with amazing people in the Education space to understand opportunities in the field. What calls to me the most is helping people go from Highschool to some sort of trade school or higher education, hopefully focused in careers of the future.

I met recently with amazing people such as [David](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-ortiz-9b64a8b/), who runs a Non-profit doing just that together with his company SIIGO; [Felipe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipevergara/), who has been providing income-share loans to underprivileged youth for over 2 years; and [Daniel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieluribevilla/), who runs one of the largest non-profits/investment vehicles for education projects in the region. Many thoughts on what problem should be attacked, but I'm still processing.

## Heatlh ‚öïÔ∏è

Sadly, I got COVID about 10 days ago. I'm completely fine now, except for the fact I completely lost the ability to smell stuff. Sad days, I was proud of my nose being extremely sensitive üëÉ
